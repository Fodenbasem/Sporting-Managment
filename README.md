# Sporting-Managment
The project is about reserving football fields all over the country through a website. I used artificial intelligence in the entire database, linking the database to the front end, generating the server, and using artificial intelligence to modify the front end.

# ⚽ Sporting Booking System & Management

A complete full-stack **football field booking** and **sport management** system. Built with a modern tech stack, powered by artificial intelligence, and optimized for fast online reservations from anywhere.

## 🧠 AI-Powered Development

This project was enhanced using **artificial intelligence** at several levels:

- **AI-Driven Database Design**: Efficient and optimized schema generation
- **Frontend Optimization**: Layout and animations built with AI assistance
- **Backend Generation**: Server and API logic crafted intelligently
- **UX Tuning**: Responsive UI and flow improved using AI design feedback
